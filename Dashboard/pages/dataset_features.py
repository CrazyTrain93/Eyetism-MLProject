The dataset has been provided by the organizing committee of the Grand Challenge Saliency4ASD from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China, and Universit√© de Nantes, France.
It is readily available for download. For contact information, access to the data, and further details, please visit the [official website](https://saliency4asd.ls2n.fr/).

The dataset consists of 300 images from the MIT1003 dataset. In multiple sessions, 14 typically developed (TD) children and 14 high-functioning ASD children, aged 5 to 12 years, were instructed to view each image. 
Each image was displayed for 3 seconds, followed by a 1-second grey image. The gaze behavior of the participants was recorded. 
The resulting scanpaths were aggregated per patient class and image, as depicted in the schema below.

The scanpaths contain information about where, how long, and how often the participant has looked during the 3-second period when the picture was displayed. 
The position of the eye gaze is depicted as x and y coordinates on the pixels of the image, along with the duration of fixation in milliseconds, representing **fixation points**.
The movement between two fixation points is called **saccades**. 
Along with these metrics, a multitude of features can be calculated. as it will be demonstrated below (add Link)
